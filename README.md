# Classic ASP Pagination records

We know that there are several ways paging with ASP, but could, in an extremely compact way, developing a style paging the wp-PageNavi, which is a plugin that use and that several bloggers use on WordPress. I used a little CSS, but that's beside the point, and MySQL database. Come on then !!

The MySQL database looks like this:

``` sh
Table Name: TabelaDados
Column 01: Codigo - INT (1) NOT NULL, PRIMARY, AUTO
Column 02: Unidade - VARCHAR (5) NULL
Column 03: Nome - VARCHAR (100) NULL
```
